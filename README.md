 ## 💡 Motivation of This Project
 The problem of missing children in South Korea is still an unresolved problem. 20,000 children go missing every year, and the number of long-term missing children over 20 years is 663 as of 2021.
 
Interest in this problem decreases as time goes by, but information of missing children is still shared through outdated methods such as paper leaflets.

We intended to solve this problem by providing information of missing children online, mobile application providing convenient user interface so that information of missing children can be easily and quickly checked.
